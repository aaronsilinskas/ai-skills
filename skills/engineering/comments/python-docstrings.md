# Python Docstrings

Formatting reference for Python docstrings. The decision of *whether* a symbol
needs a docstring at all — and the "naming → test → comment" ordering — lives
in the `comments` skill; this file covers only *how* to format the ones that
survive that test.

## Class Docstrings

Open with what the class is **for** and why it matters to the caller — not a
description of its internal mechanics.

Follow with technical contracts using concise bullet lists under named
sections. Name sections after the actual contract being expressed — these vary
by domain. Examples from an animation library:

- **Update model** — when and how state is mutated
- **Sampling model** — how values are read or queried
- **State ownership** — who owns, creates, and disposes of state

```python
class Ripple:
    """Produces an expanding ring animation centered on a point.

    Useful for highlighting events or drawing attention to a position
    in a pixel strip or grid.

    Update model:
      - Call ``update(t)`` once per frame with the current timestamp.
    Sampling model:
      - Call ``value(pos)`` per pixel after each ``update`` call.
    State ownership:
      - Owns internal phase state; safe to copy by value.
    """
```

## Method Docstrings

One line is correct when the signature already conveys the _what_. Expand only
to describe:

- Non-obvious **ordering** constraints (e.g., must call X before Y)
- **Return semantics** that aren't clear from the type annotation
- **Side effects** that affect external state

```python
def update(self, t: float) -> None:
    """Advance animation state to timestamp ``t``."""

def value(self, pos: int) -> float:
    """Return brightness at ``pos`` for the current frame, in [0.0, 1.0]."""
```

### Growing into `Args:` / `Returns:` / `Raises:`

Once a method takes more than one or two parameters, or a parameter's meaning
or constraints aren't obvious from its name and type alone, drop into
Google-style sections rather than cramming everything into the summary line:

```python
def validate_band_map(bands: dict[str, range], context: str) -> None:
    """Validate that all scope keys are valid and bands do not overlap.

    Args:
        bands: Mapping of scope key → range.
        context: Label used in error messages (e.g. ``"pixels[0].scope_rows"``).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If a key is invalid or two bands overlap.
    """
```

**An `Args:` entry documents only its own parameter — never the method's
broader contract or side effects.** If a note doesn't answer "what is this
argument, what does it mean, what must it satisfy," it belongs in the summary
line or a named section instead, not smuggled into the nearest parameter's
entry.

```python
# WRONG: is_busy() behavior is a method-level side effect, not a fact about
# the `durations` parameter
def write_pulses(self, durations: list[int]) -> None:
    """Send *durations* via the PulseOut hardware.

    Args:
        durations: Sequence of integer pulse durations (µs), alternating
            mark/space, starting with a mark. The underlying
            ``pulseio.PulseOut.send`` call blocks until transmission
            completes. ``is_busy()`` reports ``True`` for the duration of
            the call.
    """

# RIGHT: the side effect moves into the summary, Args: stays scoped to the parameter
def write_pulses(self, durations: list[int]) -> None:
    """Send *durations* via the PulseOut hardware.

    Blocks until transmission completes. ``is_busy()`` reports ``True`` for
    the duration of the call.

    Args:
        durations: Sequence of integer pulse durations (µs), alternating
            mark/space, starting with a mark.
    """
```

## `__init__` Docstrings

Do **not** add a docstring to `__init__` when the class docstring already
describes construction parameters. Duplicate documentation drifts out of sync.

## Symbol References

Use `double backticks` for values that aren't cross-references to another class
or method, including:

- Parameters and fields: `t`, `pos`
- Literals that would otherwise read as bare words: `None`, `True`, `False`
- The method's own name when referring to itself within its own docstring:
  `update()`

```python
# Correct
"""Returns ``None`` if the buffer is empty."""

# Incorrect
"""Returns None if the buffer is empty."""
```

Use Sphinx cross-reference roles instead — `` :class:`Name` `` and
`` :meth:`name` `` — when referencing another class or method by name, so the
reference resolves to a link in generated docs rather than reading as plain
text:

```python
# Correct — this is a reference to another type/method, not a value or literal
"""Transmits IR payloads through a :class:`PulseWriter`.

Starting a write calls :meth:`IrTransmitGate.begin_transmit`, then
:meth:`PulseWriter.write_pulses`.
"""

# Incorrect — loses the cross-reference
"""Transmits IR payloads through a ``PulseWriter``."""
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Class docstring leads with user-facing purpose, not mechanics
- [ ] Technical contracts are in named bullet sections
- [ ] Method docstrings are one line unless non-obvious behavior needs
      explanation
- [ ] Multi-parameter or non-obvious signatures use `Args:`/`Returns:`/`Raises:`
      blocks, and each `Args:` entry documents only its own parameter
- [ ] Plain values and literals use `double backticks`; references to other
      classes/methods use `` :class:`Name` ``/`` :meth:`name` ``
- [ ] No `__init__` docstring if class docstring covers parameters
